A farmer with his wolf, goat, and cabbage arrive at the bank of a river. A boat 
at the riverâ€™s edge is only large enough for the farmer and one of his 
possessions. The farmer cannot leave the wolf alone with the goat, or the goat 
alone with the cabbage. How may the farmer cross the river with all of his 
possessions intact?

This program solves the Farmer, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage problem by using a recursive
depth-first search as a state space approach to finding a solution.

This program uses the function (fwgc) as a simulated main and has an out-of-
function (fwgc) call placed at the bottom of the file to allow the program to be
run without entering an interpreter and manually loading the file.

        This is the simulated program main. It sets up local variables for the
        initial state of the problem and passes the into a deprth-first search.
        If the search is successful, the dfs first move to an output function to 
        print the solution path, but will then return t up the recursive calls.

        First, it will check if the farmer and the object are on the same side, 
        and thus if the farmer is able to move the object. It will then check 
        that the object was not the last one moved to prevent infinite recursion
        that could occur by repeatedly performing the inverse of the previous 
        move. Last it will call the dfs on the the state to see if a solution
        path is produced. The dfs is used here is a conditional to return t when
        the dfs returns t. This prevents a dead-end path from returning nil all
